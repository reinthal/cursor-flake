## About Cursor

Cursor is an AI-first code editor designed to enhance productivity through AI-assisted coding. It offers features like code completion, refactoring suggestions, and natural language command processing.

For more information about Cursor, visit the [official website](https://cursor.sh/).

## Installation

To install Cursor using this flake, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have flakes enabled in your NixOS configuration.

2. Add this flake to your `flake.nix`:

   ```nix
   {
     inputs = {
       nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable"; # Note that nixos unstable channel is required
       cursor.url = "github:reinthal/cursor-flake/main";
     };

     outputs = { self, nixpkgs, cursor }: {
       # Your existing configuration...
       
       nixosConfigurations.your-hostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
         # ...
         modules = [
           # ...
           ({ pkgs, ... }: {
             environment.systemPackages = [ cursor.packages.${pkgs.system}.default ];
           })
         ];
       };
     };
   }
   ```

3. Run `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` to apply the changes. It can also be registered with home manager

## Usage

After installation, you can launch Cursor from your application menu or by running `cursor` in your terminal.

## Version Management

To ensure proper version management and take full advantage of Nix's reproducibility features, we recommend the following:

1. **Disable auto-updates in Cursor**: 
   - Open Cursor
   - Go to Settings (gear icon) > Updates
   - Disable "Automatically download and install updates"

2. **Update using Nix**:
   To update Cursor, update the flake input in your `flake.nix` and rebuild your system:

   ```sh
   nix flake update
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch
   ```

This approach ensures that your Cursor version is managed atomically with the rest of your system, providing better stability and reproducibility.
